### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I have a degree in aerospace engineering, yet coding has always been my *rocket science*. I get the gist of it, but actually doing it always... disconcerts me.

So here I am, trying to learn whatever I can by doing.

Some stuff I've got on here now or in the near-future:
 * A personal website using only HTML, CSS and basic JS, and without a CMS or SSG, that brings together my profile and disparate interests, such as  writing, photography.
 * Scripts written for very specific tasks, such as converting MD to HTML, editing EXIF data in photos, etc.
 * My experiments with algorithmic computer music using Pure Data.
 
Some goals I have in mind:
 * Eventually add a blog without using a CMS. A lot of unnecessary work, I know.
 * Maybe re-write the scripts in different languages, if only to understand the advantages of each.
 * Make a website inspired by [generative.fm](generative.fm) using the music I "write."
